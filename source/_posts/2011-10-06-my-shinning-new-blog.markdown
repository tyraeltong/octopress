So finally I decided I shall switch my blog engine from **Wordpress** to **[Octopress](http://octopress.org)**. The reason behind this decision is that Wordpress is way to complex and heavy for me to hosting my little personal blog, and also I want to be able to customize it some day and also I'm too lazy to learn how to do that in php. Octopress is based on **[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)** and it's written in Ruby, which enables me to do the customization at the source code level.

The setup on my Linode VPS for Octopress is a brezz, I'll create another post to log down what I did for that. Now, just enjoy the Octopress!
