I switched over my blog engine from Wordpress to Octopress pretty fast(in 2 days), actually, the tipping point was [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). Markdown is a very simple and beautiful(in my eys) markup language which helps people to do text-to-HTML conversion. Many blog engines support it but I can hardly find a good(enough for me) plugin for Wordpress to edit the posts using Markdown.

 At the same time, I got to know this [Mou](http://mouapp.com/), the missing Markdown editor for web developers. It's a well designed Mac app, dedicated for editing Markdown, and with a preview panel which you can see your changes in style lively! With just several minutes went through the help doc of it, I immediately fall in love with it.

One thing to mention is, Mou's help file is actually a Markdown document so that you can just copy what you want over to your document, and then make modification.

All of the process in the diagram are built-in Octopress tasks except I use Mou to do the edting. It feels a lot more comportable than doing it through the web-interface or some other GUI blog authorizing tools.
